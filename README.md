PhereoRoll3D
============

![Logo](pics/logo.png)

I was frustrated to not be able to use native autostereoscopic capabilities of my ELEPHONE P8 3D to watch stereophotographs of Phereo website ; so I made this app to display them nicely. Some other display modes were added afterwards.

The app is developped in c++ with Qt/QML and a tiny bit of Java. Although only tested on Android and Linux, it is supposed to work on many platforms if compiled for them. Only Android prebuilds are provided.

**Status: Working**

This software is created on my spare time for my own usage, but I share it as a free software (MIT licence, see afterwards). If you really want to thank me for this sharing, you can find my email in my phereo profile. You can also tip me: https://jackdesbwa3d.desbwa.org/donate/

Source code is available, so if it lacks something for you, feel free to contribute yourself and share your changes back. Patches are welcome. I do not accept to be paid to add a feature, but some freelancers might do.

Compatibility
-------------

Precompiled APK are compatible down to Android API 16 which is 4.1/Jelly Bean, and down to Android API 9 which is 2.3/Gingerbread for the "retro" version.

Most 3D tablets and phones use either parallax barrier or lenticular film. The app should work with all of them.

Devices that use software-activated barrier are likely to not work, except if you can activate the barrier outside of the app. Experimental activation is present since v0.6 for some models.

**Known to be compatible:**\
Elephone P8 3D\
PPTV King 7S 3D\
Doogee Y6 Max 3D\
ZTE Axon 7 Max\
ZTE K3DX V5\
VKworld Discovery S2\
RoKiT IO Pro 3D \
Galaz N1 (in colums interleaved inverted mode) \
Truly/Freevi tablet (with retro version)\
Aikun Morphus X300\
Most computers (although there is no prebuilt version)

**Known for NOT being compatible:**\
Super D D1 (uses LCD barrier)\
InFocus M550 (uses LCD barrier)\
HTC Evo 3D (uses LCD barrier)\
LG P720 (app refuses to install)

Usage
-----

The defaults parameters are set so that when the phone is in landscape orientation, the app displays itself in column-interleaved to be seen in 3D thanks to autostereoscopic display. You can use other type of 3D thanks to other display modes.

The app opens "Popular" list at startup.

A web icon is present on the right. When clicked, it opens the image URL on phereo website. On Android, if multiple apps can open the link, the system asks you to choose which one to use. As a consequence, it is a also a quick access to official phereo app (useful to quickly add a like on a picture). 

A download icon is present on the right. It is greyed when application has not the permissions to write, with a tick when the photo is already present, and normal when you can download. Clicking on it will download the stereophoto in side-by-side (parallel) format into [Pictures]/PhereoRoll3D/ folder, or open it if it is already there.

Select the orientation you want to show/change on the left list, and show/select associated 3D mode on the right list.

A zone indicates if the cursor is visible when a mouse is used. Clicking on it change the cursor status. Note: when enabled, the cursor is visible only when the mouse moves.

Click elsewhere to come back to list view.

### Search page

First select which type of search you want to do and type your keyword. When validated, the search starts.

To be able to display in 3D, the actual input is hidden and its content copied on the two views so that you can see the text. However, it is a quite rudimentary input. The selection is drawn with an underline.

User search displays its results in this page. Other searchs display the results in the list view.

Download or build

### Precompiled APK

APK is the format used by Android for applications package. This is the only binary version distributed. You can find them in the release page of github project.

The app is not available on Google's store, but you can install by opening the APK file in your phone/tablet. Actually, there are tons of resources that explain how to install an APK, so I will not detail here.

### Build for Linux/Windows/Mac/FreeBSD/EmbeddedLinux/QNX and so on

This is a simple Qt/QML project with no external dependancy. Just get Qt on your system, configure it if needed, and build either with qmake/make in command line or by opening the project in QtCreator. See documentation of this framework for more details.
